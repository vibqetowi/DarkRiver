# DarkRiver
https://darkriver.herokuapp.com

Simulated eccommerce website built on MERN stack and there's Paypal integration because I can. 
The design is loosely inspired by the idea of a dark-themed Amazon.

Currently working: customer login, cart, checkout, paypal payment, searching for products
Not implemented: footer, admin menu, seller menu, responsiveness in some elements

This project is for fun, not for commercial applications and all copyrighted materials were used without permission. This is not a real website and I'm just some random student
