# DarkRiver
https://darkriver.herokuapp.com

Simulated ecommerce website built on MERN stack and there's Paypal integration because I can. 
The design is loosely inspired by the idea of a dark-themed Amazon.

Currently working: customer login, cart, checkout, paypal payment, searching for products.

Not implemented: footer, admin menu, seller menu, some css, some links just lead to amazon and may have pages implemented later and a few things I sprinkled as comments throughout the site.

This is not a real website and needless to say, do not enter any real information on the site.
