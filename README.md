# DarkRiver

https://darkriver.herokuapp.com

Simulated ecommerce website built on MERN stack
The design is loosely inspired by the idea of a dark-themed Amazon.

Currently working: customer login, cart, checkout, paypal payment, product search.

Not implemented: footer, admin menu, seller menu, some css, some links just lead to amazon and may have pages implemented later, hCaptcha will take a while because I haven't found a way to test it within localhost. There's also a few things I sprinkled as comments throughout the site.

This is not a real website and needless to say, do not enter any real information on the site.

update: sometime in 2022 heroku shut down free accounts so the website is dead, also I didnt't save my env variables so it doesn't work on local host right now
