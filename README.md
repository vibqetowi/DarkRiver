# DarkRiver
Simulated eccommerce website built on the React framework. The backend uses MongoDB and there's Paypal integration because I can. 
The design is loosely inspired by the idea of a dark-themed Amazon.

Currently working: customer login, cart, checkout.

This project is for fun, not for commercial applications and all copyrighted materials were used without permission. This is not a real website and I<m just some random student
